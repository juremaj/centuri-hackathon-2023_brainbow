drop the data from the drive here...

Notes on the data:

ds1:
- easiest dataset with brainbow data of one day
- could allow us to solve goals of comparing anatomy and activity cluster overlap ('color analysis')
- is the dataset with best signal-to-noise and most cells (best overall quality)

ds2:
- red anatomical channel data for a few days in a row
- could allow us to solve the registration problem
- 

ds3:
- same as ds2 but more challenging registration problem

ds4:
- hard dataset with brainbow for many days
- compared to ds1 the recording quality (snr, number of cells) is not as good, but is more reflective of general data we usually get
- this will allow us to combine the 'color analysis' and registration
- very likely we wont be able to make this work
